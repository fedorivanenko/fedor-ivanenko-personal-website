        React as Pure Function

          by @dillon_mulroy made me think about how the React mindset resembles
          the pure function model.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have to start by taking a look at the year 2013,{" "}
          <span className="whitespace-nowrap">when React was created</span>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Back then, the Model-View-Controller (MVC) model dominated. The View
          and The Model were mutable objects, which the framework kept in sync
          using controllers.
        </p>
      </Section>
      <Section>
        <p>Let{"'"}s take a look at Angular 1.x example:</p>
        <CodeBlock lang="angular-html">
          {[
            '<body ng-controller="DemoController">',
            '  <input ng-model="user.name">',
            "  <p>Hello, {{ user.name }}</p>",
            "  <script>",
            "    app.controller('DemoController', function ($scope) {",
            "      $scope.user = { name: '' };",
            "    });",
            "  </script>",
            "</body>",
          ].join("\n")}
        </CodeBlock>
        <p>
          <code>ng-model</code> creates a watcher that keeps the
          <code>user.name</code> (model) and the <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>{" "}
          (view) synchronized. When the user changes the input element in the
          DOM, Angular‚Äôs watcher updates the model and then updates the DOM
          accordingly.
        </p>

        <p>
          The problem was that thousands of watchers were mutating the DOM
          individually during each digest cycle. This had roughly{" "}
          <code>ùñÆ(number of watchers √ó number of passes)</code> complexity and
          could lead to DOM conflicts.
        </p>
      </Section>
      <Section>
        <p>React acted differently:</p>
        <CodeBlock lang="jsx">
          {[
            "var App = React.createClass({",
            "  getInitialState: function () {",
            "    return { user: { name: '' } };",
            "  },",
            "  handleChange: function (event) {",
            "    this.setState({ user: { name: event.target.value } });",
            "  },",
            "  render: function () {",
            "    return (",
            "      <div>",
            "        <input",
            "          value={this.state.user.name}",
            "          onChange={this.handleChange}",
            "        />",
            "        <p>Hello, {this.state.user.name}</p>",
            "      </div>",
            "    );",
            "  }",
            "});",
          ].join("\n")}
        </CodeBlock>
        <p>
          Here he DOM is never <em>mutated</em>; it is only <em>derived</em>{" "}
          from <code>this.state</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The whole React concept can be summarized as:
          <span className="block">
            ‚Äî The UI is a pure function of state and props
          </span>
        </p>

        <p>
          This allows React to collect all state changes and apply them together
          in a single render/reconciliation cycle. No DOM conflicts and roughly{" "}
          <code>ùñÆ(number of diffs)</code> complexity.
        </p>
      </Section>
      <Section>
        <p>With the functional syntax the model is even more obvious:</p>
        <CodeBlock lang="jsx">
          {[
            "function App() {",
            "  const [user, setUser] = useState({ name: '' });",
            "  function handleChange(event) {",
            "    setUser({ name: event.target.value });",
            "  }",
            "  useEffect(() => {",
            "    if (user.name) {",
            "      console.log(user.name);",
            "    }",
            "  }, [user.name]);",
            "  return (",
            "    <div>",
            "      <input value={user.name} onChange={handleChange} />",
            "      <p>Hello, {user.name}</p>",
            "    </div>",
            "  );",
            "}",
          ].join("\n")}
        </CodeBlock>
        <p>
          The function returns a UI derived from state and props and runs side
          effects.
        </p>

        <p>
          React forces developers to think of the UI as a pure function of data:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-inside list-['‚Äî'] space-y-1">
          <li>What data does the component depend on?</li>
          <li>How should the UI change when that data changes?</li>
          <li>What side effects should run as a result?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Folliwing this mindset makes the entire data flow explicit:</p>
        <ul className="list-inside list-['‚Äî'] space-y-1">
          <li>
            Data enters with <code>props</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Transforms in <code>state</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Leaves in <code>return()</code> or <code>effects</code>.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          It naturally leads to better abstractions and clearer separation of
          concerns.
        </p>

      <Section>
        <p>
          Using this mental model is very easy to catch why this is bad{" "}
          <em>conceptually</em>
        </p>
        <CodeBlock>
          {[
            "function Toast({ open }: { open: boolean }) {",
            "  const controls = useAnimation();",
            "",
            "  const variants = {",
            "    open:  { opacity: 1, y: 0,   transition: { duration: 0.24 } },",
            "    close: { opacity: 0, y: -12, transition: { duration: 0.18 } }",
            "  };",
            "",
            "  useEffect(() => {",
            '    controls.start(open ? "open" : "close");',
            "  }, [open, controls, variants]);",
            "",
            "  return (",
            "    <motion.div ",
            '      initial="close" ',
            "      animate={controls} ",
            "      variants={variants}",
            "    >",
            "      ...",
            "    </motion.div>",
            "  )",
            "}",
          ].join("\n")}
        </CodeBlock>
        <p>
          <code>variants</code> behaves like props but they{"'"}re not.
        </p>

        <p>
          They are not deriving from state or props, and putting them inside
          mixes animation policy with runtime logic. So when, sixteen components
          later, you decide to make every animation slightly faster, it won‚Äôt be
          fun.
        </p>

        <p>
          Moving it outside the component (ideally into CSS) keeps things easy
          to track. And&nbsp;when we decide to expand the animation system, all
          configuration is already centralized.
